# AR-Based Measurement Tool (Under Development)

This project is an Augmented Reality (AR)-based measurement tool that allows users to measure the distance between two points in real-time using their phone's camera. The frontend is built with React, while the backend will be implemented using Django. The project is still under development, with ongoing enhancements in both functionality and design.

## Features (In Progress)

- **Live Camera Feed**: Users can access their phone's camera directly within the web app to view the live video feed.
- **Point Selection**: After starting the measurement, users can select two points on the camera feed to calculate the distance between them.
- **Pixel-Based Distance Calculation**: The distance between two selected points is currently calculated in pixels.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be mobile-friendly, allowing easy access from smartphones.

## Planned Features

- **Real-World Distance Measurement**: Future updates will convert pixel distances into real-world measurements using calibration techniques.
- **Backend Integration**: The Django backend will support more advanced features like user authentication, data storage, and machine learning-based object recognition.
- **AR Enhancements**: Planned integration with AR libraries like AR.js for a better AR experience.
- **Data Science Integration**: The project will include data science techniques for enhanced measurement accuracy and object detection.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
  - React Router for navigation between pages
  - Webcam.js for accessing the camera feed
- **Backend**: Django (in progress)
- **Styling**: CSS for a dark, minimal UI
